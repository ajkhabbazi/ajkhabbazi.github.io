I’m a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue, also pursuing a specialization in Computational Science and Engineering. I work at [Herrick Laboratories](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick) in the [Kircher Research Group](https://kevinjkircher.com/). Previously, I earned an MS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia, working with Prof. [Sunny Ri Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mgUDmT8AAAAJ&hl=en), and a BS in Mechanical Engineering with Highest Honors and Distinction in Iran. I’m currently interning at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), where I develop machine learning algorithms for the Drive Unit Inverter team.

My research focuses on machine learning, optimization, and advanced control strategies for intelligent buildings and [distributed energy resources](https://kevinjkircher.com/distributed-energy-resources/). I work on both modeling and field demonstrations, using model-based and data-driven approaches to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance occupant comfort. I’ve also authored a review paper ([arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05022)) surveying 100+ peer-reviewed studies on field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for HVAC. As part of my PhD work, I was awarded the ASHRAE [Graduate Student Grant-in-Aid Award](https://www.ashrae.org/communities/student-zone/scholarships-and-grants/graduate-student-grant-in-aid-award-program#:~:text=It%20is%20awarded%20once%20each,amount%20of%20up%20to%20%2410%2C000.).

Before my PhD, I earned an MS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked with Prof. [Sunny Ri Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mgUDmT8AAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis -- "[Mixing gaseous hydrogen into natural gas distribution pipelines](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0437514)" -- supported Canada's [Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html). This work led to a publication in the [International Journal of Hydrogen Energy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.11.038) and three conference presentations. I received the Best Presentation Award (CSME 2022) and Best Paper Award (CSME 2023). I previously completed a BS in Mechanical Engineering with Highest Honors and Distinction in Iran.
