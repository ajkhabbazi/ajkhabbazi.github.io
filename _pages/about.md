I’m a second-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue, also pursuing a specialization in Computational Science and Engineering. I work at Purdue’s [Herrick Laboratories](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick) in the [Kircher Research Group](https://kevinjkircher.com/), where my research focuses on developing machine learning, optimization, and advanced control algorithms for HVAC systems in residential and commercial buildings. My work spans both modeling and field demonstrations, using model-based methods -- such as model predictive control (MPC) -- and data-driven techniques -- such as data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) and reinforcement learning (RL) -- to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve occupant comfort. I’m currently interning at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), where I develop machine learning algorithms for the Drive Unit Inverter team.

So far, I’ve written a review paper ([arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05022)) that surveys over 100 peer-reviewed publications on field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential and commercial HVAC. I presented part of this work on commercial buildings at the [8th International High-Performance Buildings Conference (2024)](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/ihpbc/473/) and the [Intelligent Building Operations (IBO) Workshop 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ3izRJVNK0&list=PLcZDMdEnS08kcgUMfKHNHn507XDJG0LGC). In support of my PhD research, I was honored to receive The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers ([ASHRAE](https://www.ashrae.org/)) Graduate Student Grant-in-Aid Award.

Before my PhD, I completed an MS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked with Prof. [Sunny Ri Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mgUDmT8AAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis -- "[Mixing gaseous hydrogen into natural gas distribution pipelines](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0437514)" -- supported Canada's [Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html). This research resulted in a in the [International Journal of Hydrogen Energy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.11.038) and three conference presentations. I’ve also received awards including the Best Presentation Award at the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering (CSME) 2022 Conference and the Best Paper Award at the CSME 2023 Conference. Earlier, I earned a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering with Highest Honors and Distinction in Iran.
